📅 Google: July 17 (World Emoji Day; previously a generic monthly calendar)
📅 Microsoft: 21st of a generic month

Apple, Google, Samsung, and JoyPixels's dates show July 17. Apple first featured this date in reference to its calendar app on July 17, 2002; originally known as iCal, the app's icon also displays July 17. Emojipedia so chose July 17 as the date for World Emoji Day, first celebrated in 2014. Several major platforms, including Google and Samsung, have since featured July 17 in honor of the occasion. Other vendors feature easter egg dates marking company founding or other milestones:

📅 Google: July 17 (World Emoji Day; previously a generic 12, as months in the year)
📅 Microsoft: generic 31 (as number of days in most months)

Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
