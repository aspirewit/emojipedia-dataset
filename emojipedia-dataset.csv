Generally depicted as a white horse head facing left with a pink or purple mane and a yellow or rainbow-colored horn.
In addition to the mythical unicorn, may be used to convey whimsy, fantasy, uniqueness, specialness, peace, and love. Often used for various content related to the LGBTQ community, thanks in part to its rainbow colors on many platforms. Also often used in association with “unicorn” startups. Sometimes used as a rainbow or holographic accent color.
Vendors implement the emoji with the same or similar design as 🐴 Horse Face, but with colorful hair and a horn.
Available as an Apple Animoji.
WhatsApp’s unicorn is facing right. Google’s unicorn previously had a brown mane, Samsung’s a pink mane. Twitter’s unicorn was previously purple-colored with a blue mane.

Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.

The number of pages and tabs vary, with Microsoft and Twitter’s designs featuring one page with a single, purple-colored tab. Facebook’s is printed with NDA, or nondisclosure agreement. Most platforms indicate text with dark lines. Apple’s design features an easter egg, addressed Dear Katie and signed Take care from John Appleseed with the text of its 1997–2002 Crazy Ones/Think Different ad campaign:
Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
