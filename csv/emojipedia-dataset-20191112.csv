Apple first featured this date in reference to its calendar app on July 17, 2002; originally known as iCal, the app's icon also displays July 17. Emojipedia so chose July 17 as the date for World Emoji Day, first celebrated in 2014. Several major platforms, including Google and Samsung, have since featured July 17 in honor of the occasion. Other vendors feature easter egg dates marking company founding or other milestones:
